## Using Rock On

You can visit [Rock On](https://rock-on-production.up.railway.app/) to try the app online.

Everything you need to visit the site and use this application without cloning to your local machine is in the link above.

If you wish to run the application locally, you may do so as well!

### Locally Running Rock On

To run "Rock On" On your machine, you must have an IDE capable of running Java 11. If you use any other Java version, you may encounter bugs.

You will also need to have the MySQL Editor application or a similar app that can run MySQL on your machine and be able to run your own local database on a port of your choosing. The default port will be 3306 and the database will automatically create itself at runtime. If you need to change the port, you can head over to the `application.properties` file and change it there.

You can add your database login info here:
"spring.datasource.username=" and "spring.datasource.password="
